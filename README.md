# surwer
A plugin for transferring player data using MySQL.

# Functions
This plugin stores the data of players in a MySQL database so that they are the same on each of your servers.
The following data is stored in the database and assigned to the player each time he/she enters the server:
- Inventory
- Enderchest
- XP
- Level
- Gamemode
- Health
- Hunger
- Saturation

# MySQL
For the plugin to work, the plugin must be connected to a MySQL database. To do this, you must enter and save the data for your database in config.yml.
Attention: The plugin stops automatically when it is started if no connection to the database could be established.
